Comparison :
Hive queries are even easier for writing than Pig queries. It is something 
which everyone has an experience with after working with databases. It takes less time for writing them
and I think hive queries are more readable than Pig. 
The logic of all map/reduce phases is hidden and you don't have to think about them.
